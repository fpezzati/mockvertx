# Does Vertx.io hates mocks?

Vertx.io is really great. The more I get into it the more I like. But I am used to write unit tests with Mockito and it looks like vertx.io needs some hard work to do to get things done because it is async. 

So here two examples about mocking a vertx.io async handler: one about MongoDB and one about MariaDB. Enjoy.

P.S: Vertx.io is great.
